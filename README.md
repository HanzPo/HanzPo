I love learning languages (for both humans & computers), developing new skills, and helping out around the community.

I am currently:
- a STEM & Envirionment SHSM student at Francis Libermann Catholic High School working towards my OSSD;
- learning how to analyze data using Python, matplotlib, pandas, and scikit-learn;
- looking for internships to further my skills and build experience.
