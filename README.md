I love learning languages (for both humans & computers), developing new skills, and going to hackathons.

I am currently:
- a STEM & Envirionment SHSM student at Francis Libermann Catholic High School working towards my OSSD;
- learning about web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React;
- looking for internships to further my skills and build experience.
